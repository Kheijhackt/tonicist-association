This is the official website of Tonicist Association founded by Acemca Lam, a world-class pianist which favorite is feux follets.

AAHHAHAHHA HELLOOOOOOO. YOU CAN CHECK IT FROM YOUR README FILE TOO.
ANYWAYYYY AHAHAHHAHA I FEEL LIKE A BOT NOW. I'M YOUR NEW CHATGPT. AS A LANGUAGE LEARNING MODEL JKKK.

Ohh wait you cannot see this. I mean, it's not synced real time. So any changes I make here won't be reflected there.
See the green lines on the left?? These indicate that these are new lines compared to the last udpates. I'm slowwwh ahhahahah.

Look on the graph on the lower left. You might see that our history isn't the same for now. It's because you cloned it before I updated new features. HAHHAHAAHHAAHHAA OMG. What is the latest update in yours?

Yes, it's because, you cloned it before I did the new changes after that. Now, try and click this... Is it now the same as m

So that arrow is the same as typing "git pull" from the terminal. It means, you're pulling new changes from the origin repository. HAhahahaha nouuuu acemcaaaa. It's okaayy at least you can play 200 wpm on a piano.

Yes, that means, whenever you open this project, it's a good habit to always pull changes before you start making changes yourself. If there's no new changes, it's okay, nothing will just happen.

So now, look, I haven't saved this readme file yet. But as I save it, I'll click ctrl s now for save...

See on the left?? It's now added on the changes. Wait, it's not on your side yet hahahhaa. Every time we save here, it's just locally saved. It's not saved on the cloud yet.

Yuppp. But it's being tracked by git. That's why we're seeing the changes on the left. I'll click it so you'll see. this is the comparison. YESSS.

Now, I'll show you how we update the cloud based on the changes from our laptop locally.

Uhh how do i say this hahahahhaha.

We have two types of changes, uncommitted and committed changes.

Uncommitted changes are changes where it's just saved using ctrl s ahhahahaha.
Committed changes are changes were we add a commit title to it, just like on the changes you see on the lower left. That means, we can never push to the cloud repository with just uncommitted changes. That's why even when I save this using ctrl s, it's not being updated there yet. Because this is still uncommitted. It's like, I just saved the file right now, but haven't committed it yet.

So first, we save the file right?? So now this readme file is uncommitted.

It's okayy nowwwww hahahahhh.

By the way you'd notice these two icons. There a blue and purple icon cloud.
The blue one is your local commits. The purple one is the remote commits. This shows if your current repository is outdated, or if the remote is the one outdated if you have new changes. Cause look let's experiment something. I'll save this file and commit it.
Thank you my prof dr.Kian finally done yayyyyyy that's gooooood.
